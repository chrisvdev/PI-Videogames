# PI-Videogames

This project is 1 of 2 big projects that I was asked to do at the "Soy Henry" Bootcamp.
It is a full-stack application where the brief was to build a Back-End made on Node.JS that consumes data from the rawg.io API to display a list of games and their details implementing the use of a PostgreSQL database to host new games. The Back-End is controllable from the Front-End, made with React.JS, through its Rest-API.
